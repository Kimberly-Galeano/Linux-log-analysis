## What I’m Practicing
- Reviewing authentication and system logs (auth.log, syslog)
- Identifying successful and failed login attempts
- Filtering logs to find specific events
- Documenting findings in a clear and easy-to-follow way

## Planned Additions
- Step-by-step investigation write-up
- Screenshots from the terminal
- Example commands with explanations
- Notes on what looks normal vs suspicious
